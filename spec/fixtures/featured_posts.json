Sounds: Kandinsky + Schoenberg","body":"<p>One of the highlights of MoMA's <i>Inventing Abstraction</i> for me was the story of Wassily Kandinsky's encounter with the work of composer Arnold Schoenberg. \u00a0The museum tells the story...</p><p><i>On January 2, 1911, the Russian artist, who was living in Munich, went to an Arnold Schoenberg concert with his partner Gabrielle M\u00fcnther, <a href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/franz-marc\">Franz Marc</a>, <a href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/alexej-von-jawlensky\">Aleksei Jawlensky</a>, and Marianne Werefkin. They were dazzled by Schoenberg's music, which set aside existing rules of harmony in favor of a new atonal compositional method. Later, over drinks, the artists discussed the congruence between his theories and Kandinsky's attempts to break from traditional figurative modes of painting. Kandinsky also grasped the connection: within days of the concert he made sketches of the performance and then distilled the figures within until only traces of the original subject remained. In the coming months, he gradually evacuated all referential content from his work.</i></p><p>\nThe orchestra performed the Second String Quartet which shocked audiences when it was performed in Vienna three years earlier. That night's performance was still met with mixed reviews, but Kandinsky was changed. He wrote to Schoenberg, \"You have realized in your work that which I\u2026have so long sought from music. The self-sufficient following of its own path, the independent life of individual voices in your compositions, is exactly what I seek to find in painterly form.\"</p><p>I'd always understood Kandinsky as a synesthetic pioneer in art history to but it was great to read about the performance that influenced to his work. As the founder of <a href=\"http://artsy.net/gene/the-blue-rider\">Der Blaue Reiter</a> group he would create and champion works that revealed a spiritual connection between color and movement, and a transcendence beyond senses and mediums.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\nYou can listen to the Second String Quartet\u00a0<a href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/121688772/playlist/3jNUtFwpWAJQtibDU4bhUC\">here</a>\u00a0and explore the connection between Kandinsky and Schoenberg further at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?artist=40\">MoMA's <i>Inventing Abstraction</i></a> site.\u00a0\u00a0</p>","summary":" One of the highlights of MoMA's Inventing Abstraction for me was the story of Wassily Kandinsky's encounter with the work of...","published":true,"featured":true,"flagged":false,"created_at":"2013-08-20T20:42:14Z","published_at":"2013-08-20T23:10:58Z","updated_at":"2013-08-22T22:40:13Z","last_promoted_at":"2013-08-22T22:40:11Z","likes_count":3,"reposts_count":0,"_type":"Post"},{"author":{"id":"51004a9b5518c847dc000065","type":"User","name":"Avant/Garde Diaries","default_profile_id":"theavgd"},"profile":{"icon":{"id":"510835316025a7b1ef0001d1","image_filename":"square.jpg","image_url":"http://static0.artsy.net/profile_icons/510835316025a7b1ef0001d1/:version.jpg","versions":["circle","square"],"x":0,"y":0,"width":140.0},"owner":{"id":"51004a9b5518c847dc000065","type":"User","name":"Avant/Garde Diaries","default_profile_id":"theavgd"},"posts_count":53,"id":"theavgd","subtype":null,"bio":"The Avant/Garde Diaries is a digital interview magazine that documents personal views on the avant-garde.","default_icon_version":"square","owner_type":"User","follows_count":633,"short_description":"A digital magazine that documents personal views on the avant-garde"},"attachments":[{"id":"52153d679c18db9153000077","type":"PostImage","position":1,"image_versions":["small","large","larger"],"image_url":"http://static3.artsy.net/post_images/52153d679c18db9153000077/:version.jpg","original_height":397,"original_width":480,"aspect_ratio":1.21},{"id":"52153d76139b21abd2000070","type":"PostImage","position":2,"image_versions":["small","large","larger"],"image_url":"http://static2.artsy.net/post_images/52153d76139b21abd2000070/:version.jpg","original_height":521,"original_width":480,"aspect_ratio":0.92},{"id":"52153d87139b21054b0000bb","type":"PostImage","position":3,"image_versions":["small","large","larger"],"image_url":"http://static0.artsy.net/post_images/52153d87139b21054b0000bb/:version.jpg","original_height":755,"original_width":480,"aspect_ratio":0.64},{"id":"52153d97275b2462c0000097","type":"PostImage","position":4,"image_versions":["small","large","larger"],"image_url":"http://static2.artsy.net/post_images/52153d97275b2462c0000097/:version.jpg","original_height":395,"original_width":480,"aspect_ratio":1.22}],"artworks":[],"shareable_image_url":"http://static3.artsy.net/post_images/52153d679c18db9153000077/large.jpg","content_links":[],"post_images":[{"id":"52153d679c18db9153000077","type":"PostImage","position":1,"image_versions":["small","large","larger"],"image_url":"http://static3.artsy.net/post_images/52153d679c18db9153000077/:version.jpg","original_height":397,"original_width":480,"aspect_ratio":1.21},{"id":"52153d76139b21abd2000070","type":"PostImage","position":2,"image_versions":["small","large","larger"],"image_url":"http://static2.artsy.net/post_images/52153d76139b21abd2000070/:version.jpg","original_height":521,"original_width":480,"aspect_ratio":0.92},{"id":"52153d87139b21054b0000bb","type":"PostImage","position":3,"image_versions":["small","large","larger"],"image_url":"http://static0.artsy.net/post_images/52153d87139b21054b0000bb/:version.jpg","original_height":755,"original_width":480,"aspect_ratio":0.64},{"id":"52153d97275b2462c0000097","type":"PostImage","position":4,"image_versions":["small","large","larger"],"image_url":"http://static2.artsy.net/post_images/52153d97275b2462c0000097/:version.jpg","original_height":395,"original_width":480,"aspect_ratio":1.22}],"_id":"52153ce59c18db8c26000077","id":"theavgd-eye-on-hilary-faye","title":"Eye On: Hilary Faye","body":"<p>Melbourne based designer Hilary Faye\u2019s dexterity of skills is bringing a new life to collage.

My painting teacher suggested collaging as a way to come up with compositions to paint. Which worked well, but I eventually became solely engrossed in making collages, as my forgotten paint hardened on a palette nearby.</p><p><b>Where do you find the imagery for your collages? Do you use your own photographs?<br></b>I generally find my images from old magazines and photo-books at second hand stores (op shops as they are fondly called in Australia). National Geographic, commonly used by collage artists, has been a wondrous source of varied imagery from all over the world. The 'travel' section of op shop books usually deliver a range vintage travel books that are filled with full-page colour photographs, and have amusing titles such as \"Let's Travel in the Soviet Union\" and \"Scotland in camera-colour\". I haven't used my own photographs in collage thus far, but perhaps this could be a possibility for the future.<br><b><br>What is the strangest dream you can recall?<br></b>That's a really hard question! I have strange dreams all the time. The most intense dream that comes to mind was my first proper lucid dream earlier this year. It came out of nowhere and really shook me up. I realised it was a lucid dream when I was looking at a clock and the hands started whizzing around really fast.

Sally Mann from 2000, wherein the artist describes her photographic process, including an overview of the wet plate collodion process practiced by the artist since the mid-1990s.</i></p><p><b>ART21</b>: What triggered the desire to use glass-plate negatives?</p><p><b>MANN</b>: I guess, because I was so immersed in that whole glass-plate, nineteenth-century aesthetic, it was natural to want to learn how to do this. Back in the early \u201970s, when we came back from Europe, Larry and I were poking around up in the attic of this five-story building on the [Washington and Lee] campus. And we found this collection of glass negatives that had been taken around Lexington, right after the Civil War, by a local photographer. In fact, he photographed at the cabin, right here on the farm. It was an amazing moment when I held up a glass plate\u2014and damn, it was a picture of the same cliffs that I\u2019ve looked at my whole life, exactly as they are now, even the little vines hanging down. Those same vines are still there. And these ancient arborvitae trees, which obviously had fallen over one hundred years ago\u2014there they were, in the glass plate.</p><p>It was a moving thing, to see these images and be able to retrace his steps to a certain extent. He photographed the landscape around here beautifully, and of course it\u2019s the aesthetic I\u2019m most partial to. I love those [John Beasly] Greene pictures, and Gustav LeGray and Atget. I\u2019m surprised it took me this long to get to this process, because I\u2019ve always admired that aesthetic and find it redolent with past. I just need to inject a little of the present in it. Obviously, I don\u2019t want to take the same pictures he took.</p><p><b>ART21</b>: How much time did it take you to master the technique?</p><p><b>MANN</b>: I never mastered it.</p><p><i>Sally Mann was first featured by Art21 in Season 1 of the series, \"Art in the Twenty-First Century.\" Read the <a href=\"http://www.art21.org/texts/sally-mann/interview-sally-mann-collodion-process?utm_source=art.sy&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Art21_Artsy\">full interview</a> and watch <a href=\"http://www.art21.org/artists/sally-mann/videos?utm_source=art.sy&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Art21_Artsy\">videos</a>\u00a0featuring the artist at Art21.org.</i></p><p><i>Additional images: Sally Mann at her Lexington, Virginia home, 2000.

is Llyn Foulkes and Why Does He Matter?","body":"<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/llyn-foulkes\">Llyn Foulkes</a> is not quite the enigma you\u2019ve imagined. He brands himself as a \u201cZelig\u201d of contemporary art, and yet while we\u2019d love to imagine the artist as the nondescript, shadow-looming Woody Allen character, his position in the art world is much to the contrary. Since May, Foulkes\u2019 work has been on view at the Punta della Dogana, Palazzo Grassi during the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/feature/the-55th-venice-biennale\">55th Venice Biennale</a>, and currently, fills the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/newmuseum\">New Museum</a> in a retrospective that\u2014somehow\u2014is the artist\u2019s first New York museum exhibition in his 50-year career. <i>Learn why you absolutely should be in the know when it comes to Llyn Foulkes.</i></p><p><b>1. Llyn Foulkes has always kept ahead of the curve.</b></p><p>Foulkes showed the year before <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol\">Andy Warhol</a> at Los Angeles\u2019 visionary Ferus Gallery (the 1960s West Coast space famous for housing many of today\u2019s biggest artist\u2019s first shows). In the company of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/john-baldessari\">John Baldessari</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/robert-irwin\">Robert Irwin</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/ed-ruscha\">Ed Ruscha</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/wallace-berman\">Wallace Berman</a>, Foulkes was <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://llynfoulkes.com/?page_id=8\">named</a> an early master of Pop\u2014who, it should be noted, debuted his Cow painting three years prior to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/artwork/andy-warhol-cow-f-and-s-ii-dot-11a\">Warhol\u2019s cattle prints</a>.

His career retrospective, currently on view at the New Museum, was organized and originally displayed by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://artsy.net/hammer_museum\">Hammer Museum</a> and will soon travel to Museum Kurhaus Kleve in Germany. The artist has also brought home his share of prizes\u2014in 1963, he was the first recipient of LACMA\u2019s Young Talent Award, and in \u201967 he was awarded first prize at the Paris Biennale. To name a few other feats, Foulkes participated in the 2011 Venice Biennale, Documenta 13 (where he also performed\u2014more on that later) and the seminal \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d exhibition at the MOCA in \u201992\u2014one of the most provocative and talked-about exhibitions of the \u201990s.</p><p><b>3.
